Step 1: Determine the set that contains all possible points:
\[\Omega = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb R^2 \colon x^2 + y^2 \leq r^2\}   \]
\[\prob[s_1] = \frac{A_{s_1}}{A_\Omega} = \frac{\pi r^2 - B}{8\pi r^2}\]


\begin{problem}
  The rod of length L.\\
  A rod of length $l$ is split randomly into 3 parts by making two cuts at random distances $x$ and $y$ from one end.\\

  \textbf{Step 1:} Determine the set that contains all possible point:
  \begin{align*}
    \Omega &= \{(x,y) \colon 0 \leq x \leq l \text{ and } 0 \leq y \leq l \}\\
    A_\Omega & = l^2
  \end{align*}

  \textbf{Step 2:} Identify the region for which our condition holds, namely the values of $x$ and $y$ for which \emph{a triangle can be formed}.

  Case 1: $x<y$ 
    \begin{align*}
      \frac{l}{2} &< y-x\\
      \implies y &> x + \frac{l}{2}
    \end{align*}
  Case 2:  $y<x$ 
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{l}{2} &> x-y\\
    \implies y &> x - \frac{l}{2}
  \end{align*}

  \[\prob[\text{triangle is formed}] = \frac{l^2 / 4}{l^2} = \frac{1}{4}\]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
  Buffon's needle.\\
  A needle of lenght $l$ is thrown randomly on a plane which is ruled by infinite parallel lines equally seperated by a distande $d$, where $l<d$. We wish to find the probability that the needle intersects one of them.

  Let $x$ be the distance of the mid=point of the needle to the closest line. There are three extreme cases. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item  One where the needle does not touch any of the rules (lands in between),
  \item one in which one end of the needle just touches one of the rules,
  \item and the final where the midpoint of the needle intersects one of the rules.
\end{itemize}
  
\textbf{Step 1:} Identify the set of all possible outcomes.
\[\Omega = \{(x,\theta) : 0 \leq x \leq \frac{l}{2} ; 0 \leq \theta \leq \pi\} \]

\end{problem}

A system of $m$ equations in $n$ variables $x_1,\, x_2, \cdots x_n$ is homogeneous if it is in the form \[\matr A \matr X = \matr 0.\] Such a system always has one solution (\emph{the trivial solution}), namely $x_1 = 0,\, x_2 = 0,\, \cdots,\, x_n = 0$. Such a system might also have an infinite set of solutions in the possibility that $\rank{A} < n$.

\remark{If the number of equations ($m$) is less than the number of variables ($n$) \emph{i.e. $m < n$}, then the system has a non trivial solution.

\begin{definition}
  Let \matri{A} be an $n \times n$ matrix. A non-zero n-vector $\matr x$ such that $$\matr A \matr x = \lambda \matr x$$ is called an \textbf{eigenvector} of \matri A with corresponding \textbf{eigenvalue} $\lambda$.
\end{definition}~\\
To find the eigenvalues, consider $\matr{Ax} = \lambda \matr{x}$.
\begin{align*}
  \matr{Ax} - \lambda\matr x &= 0\\
  (\matr{A} - \lambda\matr{I})\matr{x} &= 0
\end{align*}
The above, is a homogenous system of equations which must ahve a solution other than $\matr x = 0$. 

The eigenvalues of a matrix \matri{A} are the values of $\lambda$ that satisfy the following equation, which is referred to as the \emph{characteristic equation}. 
\[\det(\matr{A} - \lambda\matr I) = 0.\]
